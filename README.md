Make sure that mobspawning is enabled otherwise the resource pack will brake.

# How to solve if disabled

 If ```mobspawning``` is disabled and you are ingame or running a server which you can't modify without accessing ```server.properties```,
use this command ingame 

/gamerule domobspawn = true


or just type the command in my ```Minecraft Bedrock Server Control Panel GUI``` Wrapper that I made for the bedrock dedicated server 
software made by Mojang which you can clone here:
