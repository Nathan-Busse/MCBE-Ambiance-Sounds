# MCBE-Ambiance-Sounds

Bring the sound of nature into your world,
and listen to the calm acoustics of birds chirping and crickets singing,
the calls of exotic animals from many bioms stretching far and wide.

Listen to the wind blow in scorching dessert and the waves crashing on the sea shore.

Enjoy.

# NOTE!!! 

Make sure that ```domobspawning``` is *enabled* otherwise the resource pack will brake.

# How to solve if disabled

 If ```mobspawning``` is disabled and you are ingame or running a server which you can't modify without accessing ```server.properties```,
use this command ingame:

      
    /gamerule domobspawning true
      

or just type the command like this in the ```send command``` tab like this:


    gamerule domobspawning true


in my ```Minecraft Bedrock Server Control Panel GUI``` Wrapper that I made for the bedrock dedicated server 
software made by Mojang which you can clone here:
